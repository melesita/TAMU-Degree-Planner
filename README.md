# TAMU-Degree-Planner

This degree planner uses data scraped from the Texas A&M UCC Requirements website and the base degree plan provided by the university to generate a complete degree plan by implementing the OpenAI environment.

## Implementation:

* __Links and Majors Handling:__ Retrieves and displays available majors from provided URLs.
* __User Input Handling:__ Prompts the user to select a major and input their AP exam scores.
* __Web Scraping:__ Uses BeautifulSoup to scrape the degree requirements from the selected major's webpage.
* __AP Exam Credits Processing:__ Matches user's AP credits against degree requirements.
* __UCC Credit Calculation:__ Calculates remaining UCC credits needed and suggests courses to fulfill them.
